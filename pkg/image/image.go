// Package image is the public, provider-agnostic image generation interface.
// It exists as a standalone client library separate from the generate_image
// agent tool (internal/tools/multimedia/imagegen.go) so a host application
// can call generation directly - e.g. a UI where a human types a prompt -
// without going through an LLM tool-calling loop for a deterministic action
// the human already decided to take. The same provider implementations
// (pkg/image/providers) power both call sites.
