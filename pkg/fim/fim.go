// Package fim is the public Fill-in-the-Middle code completion interface -
// a standalone client library separate from the code_complete agent tool.
// FIM is explicitly suited to IDE integrations and in-editor ghost text: a
// host application (e.g. an editor UI) can call completion directly for
// each keystroke/pause without an LLM tool-calling loop deciding whether to
// call it - that decision doesn't make sense for this use case, the human
// (or editor) already triggered it deterministically.
